      <description>Languages are complicated, and every language is complicated in different ways that can be hard to understand. Some form words from multiple characters while others have symbols that represent entire concepts. Some features words without pluralization or gender and rely on context for that while others have two or more genders for words. Some are very phonetic while others pronounce words seemingly at random (cough English, though cough).
Thanks to a tremendous contribution from then community member Elias Nahum long ago, we have full support for translation throughout Mattermost, and thanks to our community of translators, Mattermost is usable by many people speaking a variety of different languages.</description>
