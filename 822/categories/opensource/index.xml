      <description>At the start of implementing Docker Content Trust in our workflow, I thought it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take so long. I thought and of course I was wrong. The following is the boiled down version of what I learned and wished for starting out.
Prerequisites  Docker version: 19.03.12 root *.key + passphrase for the Docker Content Trust delegation/signer private key *.key + public key *.pub + passphrase for the delegated person/bot, who should sign the repository/image:tag Please make sure you have your keys backed up and versioned.</description>
