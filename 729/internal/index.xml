      <description>When an employee leaves the company, any credentials they had should be revoked. The more things they had access to, the harder this is, so when onboarding, it&amp;rsquo;s important to give them only the necessary privileges. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to avoid shared secrets that cannot be revoked from one person.
The following is a list of things to do. It should be kept as complete and up-to-date as possible, but treated as non-comprehensive when offboarding someone.</description>

      <description>Note: To cut a build you need access to matterbuild. Please ask Christopher/Jason/Elisabeth for access if you don&amp;rsquo;t have it.
Developers and PMs decide when to create the release branch. The branch can be created from master or from an existing release branch, depending on which type of release we are planning. If it is a Quality Release, the new branch should be branched off the previous release, otherwise the branch should be off the master branch.</description>

      <description>Engaging with Community Mattermost takes pride in working with the community and we encourage each Mattermost developer to find one or more community members to work with. Here is a basic three-step process for engaging with the community:
 Welcoming - Be welcoming and warm to new members. Go out of your way to say hello, offer them help and overall make them feel like part of the Mattermost tribe. Shepherding - Find pull requests members are struggling with.</description>

      <description>Been to a conference recently? Worked on something cool? Got something else Mattermost-related you want to post about? Writing a blog post is a great way to share your experience with the community.
Blog posts can cover a wide range of topics, such as:
 Addressing a customer-facing problem Describing an experience with Mattermost/your Mattermost implementation Sharing information about cool tech Sharing feedback on an interesting talk or conference Part of a Hackathon project A Help Wanted ticket A knowledge-share and call for feedback/community engagement A discussion of a specific problem or improvement that you worked on A breakdown of a new process or technology you’re using  Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got the topic in mind - what it&amp;rsquo;s about, what you want to achieve with the post, and what the next steps are - it’s sometimes helpful to start writing the conclusion and expand to your jumping off point to introduce your topic/idea/discovery draws.</description>

      <description>The Sustained Engineering Team (SET) is responsible for improving and maintaining quality.
Team Members SET is a rotating team that is comprised of engineers from the different feature teams. The rotation is on a two week cycle. Who is currently on SET can be seen in the header of the ~Sustained Engineering channel.
Feature teams will commit a total of 4 engineers plus a lead to SET for each rotation. While on SET, that engineer should attend their feature team&amp;rsquo;s sprint planning but should not be assigned any work from their feature team.</description>
